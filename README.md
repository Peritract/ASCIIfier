<h1>ASCIIfier</h1>
<h1>Convert images to ASCII</h4>

This is a simple text-based Python program to convert images into ASCII representations. I am indebted to [Praveen Kumar's tutorial on this](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/beautiful-python-a-simple-ascii-art-generator-from-images/), which I used as a starting point. 

It relies on PIL(Pillow), but otherwise nothing else.
