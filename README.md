# ASCIIfier
Convert images to ASCII

I wrote this based on an article by Praveen Kumar (https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/beautiful-python-a-simple-ascii-art-generator-from-images/), but I have extended and altered it. That's not to say I've made it better, but just to say that I haven't simply stolen his code.

It relies on PIL(Pillow), but otherwise nothing else.
